# README

This is my new English weblog. I started to experiment with `blogdown` and `Hugo` in October 2017. After a long interruption I restarted the work for this website in July 2018. 

In my German weblog [Gedankensplitter](http://peter.baumgartner.name) I focus(ed) on educational design of blended learning scenarios whereas here I will write mainly about new workflows and tools for scientific research. Both sites are related to educational technology, but with this one I want to focus on data literacy, reproducible research and new workflows permitted by the present digital era. 

As the discussion in these areas -- especially the development of tools in the R Markdown ecosystem -- is (currently ?) almost exclusively an international one I decided to blog on this subject in English. I am a little afraid to produce stale prosa and that blogging in my poor English will not always be fun --- neither for me nor for the reader.
