# README

This will become the accompanying website for my new German book "Werkzeuge und Methoden des wissenschaftlichen Arbeitens: Forschung im digitalen Zeitalter" (working title). In English I would call it "Reproducible research in the digital era: New tools and workflows.""

All details like 

* HOW-TOs (registration, installat√≠on procedures ETC.), 
* URLs, 
* reviews of products and services 

should go into the website. The book by contrast will cover the overall architecture of the new research framework, strategies, trends, initaitives and will explain new workflows (with concrete examples on the website.
