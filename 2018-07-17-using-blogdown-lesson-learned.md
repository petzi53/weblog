Finally --- after almost one year of interruption --- I could reorganise my responsibilites to spend more time working with blogdown and Hugo. 

But (re-)starting blogging using these tools was not easy after such a long period. I did not only forget many procedures but ran also into compatibility problems with the necessary updates. It turned out for me that the R Markdown ecosphere produces not only valuable and powerful tools but is a continuously changing complex endevour still stricken with some fragilities.

<p>But in this post I don't want predominantly focus on these difficulties but on the lesson I learned in the last couple of week.</p>

I am/was using the very powerful [docdock-theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/docdock/) which has many exciting features. I was especially intruiged by using dynamic slides with the [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/#/) html framework, which I used heavily on https://notes.peter-baumgartner.net/slide/.

This site is itself work in progress as I am busy learning about the many nice features of R Markdown, of  template and how to adapt them for my needs. This means to learn a lot about Hugo and its templates structure. But this is already part of the content (tools) I want to write about. Explore the many features of this website for yourself in the archive section.

The structure and appearance of the site is still under construction, but there are already some articles you could be interested in. I will add articles and at the same time I will continue to work on functionality and design of this site as a somewhat never ending endeavour.
