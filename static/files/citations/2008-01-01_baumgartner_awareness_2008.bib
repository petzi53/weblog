  abstract = {The provision of licence free educational resources can be regarded as a major trend in education. Since the launch of the first open courseware projects in 2002, numerous initiatives followed. In the meantime we can talk about a worldwide Open Educational Resources (OER) movement. In advancing this movement several challenges are to be met, awareness raising and community building being top priorities. The MEDIDA-PRIX 2008 (Mediendidaktischer Hochschulpreis) is an initiative that intends to function as a change agent in order to sensitize the community to the idea of the OER movement.},
