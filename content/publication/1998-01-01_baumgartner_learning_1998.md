abstract = "Reflection on the forms and possibilities of Internet use in education does not keep pace with the speed with which access for schools is provided worldwide. For an in-depth educational discussion, we need to differentiate types of Internet applications. We will present a model that was developed for the categorization and evaluation of (stand-alone) interactive media and that we use now to contribute to a more detailed and specific educational discussion of Internet use. After a short review of the foundations on which the model is built we will illustrate its application to the Internet, using existing sites as examples."
