abstract = "Throughout the last 100 years instructional theory has developed many different educational models and learning scenarios. What schools are still missing is not only an educationally sound and complete categorization scheme, but also the application of these models to the new forms and types of virtual learning environments. Traditionally these educational scenarios lack detailed and finely granulated descriptions."
