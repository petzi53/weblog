abstract = "Based on the didactical scenario approach by Baumgartner/Bergner we explore over 50 educational interaction patterns, which are the components of every learning scenario. In contrast to the traditional literature, which is mostly lacking in granularity, we think that schools as well as other institutions of education need a more detailed description. The aim is to break down educational scenarios into smaller units (interaction patterns) that can be handled by teachers. Following this approach they can plan their classes and choose the adequate technical tools for the virtual learning experience."
