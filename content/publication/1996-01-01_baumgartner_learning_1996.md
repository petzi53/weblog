abstract = "After outlining some problems of evaluation methods that are commonly used in the attempt to assure the quality of interactive educational media, the authors present their heuristic model of the learning process. It has the advantage of bringing the social aim and situation of the learning process into focus. This model is the basis for a qualitative approach to software evaluation which helps to define appropriate and creative settings for the use of the software."
