I am professor of Education Technology and was until my retirement (July 1, 2018) [Head of the Department of Interactive Media and Educational Technologies](http://www.donau-uni.ac.at/en/department/imb/index.php) at [Danube University Krems](http://www.donau-uni.ac.at/en/index.php). My research interests include the acquisition of digital competences using principles of teaching, epistemology and reproducible research methods, development of (higher) educational institutions with focus on service learning and social change through innovation and digitization.

I have held positions as professor at several universities  (Klagenfurt, MÃ¼nster, Innsbruck, Hagen) before I accepted the nomination to Krems. I published 12 books (7 monographs and 5 edited volumes) and more than 120 articles. Beside this new English site (started July 2018) I am also blogging in German since 2006 at [Gedankensplitter](http://peter.baumgartner.name).
