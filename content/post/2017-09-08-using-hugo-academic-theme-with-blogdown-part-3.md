The first two parts are essential the same whatever theme you are going to choose from the [Hugo theme wsebsite](https://themes.gohugo.io/). Here we will look into some necessary adaptions before we going to publish our new website.

1. After we have finishing the installation we have got a red warning. At that time we didn't bother about it. We have the [picture of step number 8](/2017/09/04/tutorial-hugo-academic-theme-with-blogdown-part-1/) of the first part ot this tutorial starting point for the third part replicated. {{< figure src="/img/blogdown-tutorial/four-pane-view-after-installation.png" title="RStudio's four pane view immediately after installation. " >}}

2. After the installation `config.toml` is opended automatically by RStduio. We add the recommended line `ignoreFiles = ["\\.Rmd$", "\\.Rmarkdown$", "_files$", "_cache$"]` in an upper place. On this occasion we also change the baseurl (first line) to `/`. After saving theses changes the version control (Git tab right upper pane) will display `config.toml` with a blue `M` (modified). {{< figure src="/img/blogdown-tutorial/changes-in-config-toml.png" title="Some changes in the config.toml " >}}

3. Before we start posting our website locally we should arrange that the local server runs as a background process (= aka to demonize the server). You can run the command `
options(servr.daemon = TRUE)` on the console (lower left pane), but -- as I am using this process all the time -- I prefer to write this line into my start up file. On this occasion I also add some other convenient commands to facilitate the generation of new posts. See the [blogdown page on global options](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/global-options.html) for more details.  {{< figure src="/img/blogdown-tutorial/set-options-in-rprofile.png" title="Set Options in Rprofile. " >}}

4. We can now start the local servers: Choose from the "Addins" menue the "Serve Site" option. This will run the command `blogdown::serve_site()` to build the site to get a live preview of the website locally.  {{< figure src="/img/blogdown-tutorial/serve-site.png" title="Choose 'Serve Site' to get a live preview of the website locally." >}}

5. Blogdown is building the site and will give you the local server address. It is normally `http://127.0.0.1:4321/`. While the server is demonized you can still use the console, otherwise a small red stop sign will appear in the right corner of left lower pane and no command can be run in the console window. The best way to stop the server is to restart R (shortcut = `CMD + SHIFT + F10`). {{< figure src="/img/blogdown-tutorial/getting-local-server-address.png" title="Set Options in Rprofile. " >}}

6. We can now inspect our website in a browser with the web address `http://127.0.0.1:4321/`. Whenever we type something in one of our files and save the changes blogdown will rebuild the site and we can inmmediately see the changes in the browser via the local address. {{< figure src="/img/blogdown-tutorial/first-view-website-locally.png" title="First view of live preview locally. " >}} 

7. You can now adapt the personal information in your config.toml file. Read the documentation which comes inluded as post of the sample site with the hugo-academic theme we have downloaded: `http://127.0.0.1/#post`. We could for instance change the title of the website from 'Academic' to 'Blogdown Test'. {{< figure src="/img/blogdown-tutorial/first-change.png" title="Changed title from 'Academic' to 'Blogdown Test' " >}}

8. To write posts choose 'New Post' from the Addins menu. {{< figure src="/img/blogdown-tutorial/new-post.png" title="Create a new post. " >}} 

9. This will open up a window to fill in metadata. This form is already populated with the variable from our .Rprofile, so that you only have to add the post title. File name and slug will be generated automatically from the post title. Categories and tags can be filled now â€“- or later written in the file header or via the Addins menu 'Update Metadata' added. {{< figure src="/img/blogdown-tutorial/new-post-form.png" title="Fill in the prepopulated post form. " >}}

10. The 'New Post' form creates a new file for the post. The first few lines are filled with metadata of the post. You start with the post text under the second three dashes of the post header. To format your text nicely learn the Markdown  {{< figure src="/img/blogdown-tutorial/first-text-entry.png" title="First post entry. " >}}

11. After saving your text, you can finally inspect your first post locally! Posts in the hugo-academic theme can be found in post section of the website. {{< figure src="/img/blogdown-tutorial/first-post.png" title="Your first post!" >}}


{{% alert note %}}
It may be the case that the generation of you first post produces a warning. After Hugo version 0.24 a prototpy for new generated files is necessary. In that case create a file with the command `file.edit("archetype/default.md")` and add the example text written in the warning message.
