But this is not all. What follow is a list of critiques of Disqus I have seen discussed on the Internet:

* 
* Disqus does not allow Markdown,
* Disqus does not allow anonymous content  (IP address, email and name is recorded), 
* Disqus is hosted in the USA which is considered to have less stricter privacy laws than Europe,
*
