After one year interruption where I did not have time to dedicate to my new English web presence I restarted to work with blogdown and Hugo. But I ran into compatibility problems with the necessary updates: Not with blogdown respectivley with the R/RStudio side but with Hugo and themes updates.

I am/was using the very powerful [docdock-theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/docdock/) which has many exciting features. I was especially intruiged by using dynamic slides with the [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/#/) html framework, which I used heavily on https://notes.peter-baumgartner.net/slide/.
