## Some definitions

Before start with the installation procedure let us define the different ingredients we are going to use:

1. [Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) is an R package for creating static websites with R Markdown. 
2. [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) is an integrated suite of open source software facilities for statistical computing and includes tools for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display.
2. [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is an integrated development environment (IDE) which sits on top of R and facilitates the use of R tremendously.
3. [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is a file format for making dynamic documents with R. It is based on Markdown (a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax), but it also can contain chunks of embedded R code.
4. [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is a popular open-source static website generator.
5. [hugo-academic](https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/) is a theme designed for Hugo to create an academic or personal website. Besides special academic features like sections for publications, projects, teaching it also includes a blog section and supports multilingual usage.

## Preliminary preparations: Installing R and RStudio

There are many tutorials to install R and Rstudio. See for instance the video [Installing R and RStudio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX532N_XLIs). But at the moment the new version of RStudio which facilitats the installation procedure of blogdown is still not released. But you can use all these new features by [downloading the preview release](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/).[^1] As these features will be soon the standard version of RStduio I explain the installation procedure with it.

[^1]: The RStudio version has to be higher than v1.1.28: At the moment (2017-09-04) the new version v1.1.353 is not the standard version and can therefore be downloaded only as preview version. This version works great; I couldnâ€™t find any problems. It has the advantage that you can use some simplification and automated routines during the installation process. 

## Create a website project

After installing a RStudio version greater than 1. v.1.1.28 open a "New Project" in RStudio.

<!-- 
The following r code has to be knitted in order to produce a html/pdf/word file e.g. for bookdown.
The picture is not be seen as static website with hugo
```{r new-project, fig.cap='Create a new project.', fig.align='center', out.width='80%', echo=FALSE} 
 knitr::include_graphics('../../static/img/blogdown-tutorial/01-new-project.png')
```
