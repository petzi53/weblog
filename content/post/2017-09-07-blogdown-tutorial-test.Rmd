Picture with Hugo shortcode should now show up


```{r starting-point, echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("figure", src = '"/img/blogdown-tutorial/four-pane-view-after-installation.png"', alt = "Some alt text")
```
YEP! It worked!

Now the next questions is the behavior with `draft: yes`.


But shortcode works, here is a tweet card:
```{r echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode('tweet', '852205086956818432')
```


Picture with knitr:

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/blogdown-tutorial/four-pane-view-after-installation.png")
```

Picture with standard markdown: Image is shown but the alt text  also shown:

![my alt text](/img/blogdown-tutorial/four-pane-view-after-installation.png)
