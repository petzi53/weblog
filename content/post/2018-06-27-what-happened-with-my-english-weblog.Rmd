The static website generator I am using for this weblog is `blogdown`. Blogdown itself is developed to make writing for the web as easy as possible. At least this is the intention and the theory. But blogdown is also a very sophisticated tool. It is not only built upon many other technologies but has also built-in a lot of facililties which themselves are using advanced technologies. As long as you keep using just the default options most of these complexities are hidden. But if you want to use some of the provided nice features --- and I am sure that there will come the time where you want like me to adjust something to your growing needs --- then some difficulties could emerge. At least this happened to me.

## Some observations

+ **Draft:** The default draft option is `draft: true`. This means that after deploymen with Netlify would not show this article live on the internet.  So I can safely make my commits to GitHub until the article is ready for publication and a I set `draft: false`. I can also withdraw articles by setting `draft: true` again.

+ **Rmd-File:** I am not sure if there aren't some imcompatiblities with my very special (advanced) theme, especially concerning the creation of new types of pages. But there should be no problem as I can always change the file extension latern on. 
        - At the moment I am not writing about R topics where I would need .Rmd files. But this could change in the very near future, e.g. when I writing posts to SO, to the learnr packages or other R subjects. 
        - The intermediate hmtl-files can be cleaned up with the button "Clean All" under the "More" menue using the command `rmarkdown::cleansite()`.

+ **Compiling:** There is a slight difference between using the RStudio addin "Serve Site" using `blogdown:::serve_site()` or the "Build Website" button using `rmarkdown::render_site(encoding = 'UTF-8')`. Whereas `serve_site()` always displays the homepage, remains render_site()` on the page I am working on.

## Checklist for new blogdown project

1. Immediately after the project is started, create two git branches: `config` and `posts` to prevent that everything is directly commited into the `master` branch.
2. Change to branch config and do the necessary changes in the config.toml


## config.toml

+ Add `title = "<name of website>"`
+ Add `themes = "<name of theme used>"`
+ Add `themesdir= "<path-to-theme>"`
+ Add `ignoreFiles = ["\\.Rmd$", "\\.Rmarkdown$", "_files$", "_cache$"]`
+ Backup your site and run `blogdown::hugo_convert(to = "YAML", unsafe = TRUE)`
+ Set `relativeURLs = true` (default is false) to view your website with the `build_site()` command (shortcut: CMD-SHIFT-B). 
+ You can always view your site locally with the `serve_site()` command (shortcut: CTRL-S) in the viewer pane or in the browser with a click in "Show in a new window" icon, right from the broom icon in the viewer pane.
